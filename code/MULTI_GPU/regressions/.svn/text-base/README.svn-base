Running Full Regressions and Performance Comparisons
----------------------------------------------------

To run the full set of regressions and performance comparisons you will first
need to install PowerGraph.  We recommend this release: graphlabapi_v2.1.4679.tar.gz

Get the downloads here: https://code.google.com/p/graphlabapi/downloads/list

See the graphlab documentation for their installation instructions.

To download the large graphs we use for testing you will need wget and python
installed.  Go into the directory ../largePerformanceGraphs/ and type 'make'.
This will download all the necessary graphs and massage them into the correct
format.

To build the powergraph reference implementations, go into
PowerGraphReferenceImplementations/ and edit the Makefile so that GRPAHLAB_DIR
points to the location where you installed graphlab.  Then type 'make' to build
the reference programs.

To run the regressions go into regressions/. Type:

'make gold' to run the reference implementations on the datasets.
'make test' to run the GPU GAS Engine programs on the datasets.
'make regress' to compare the results.

'make' will run all three commands at once.

The generated files have the following format:

[graph_name].[algorithm].gold       - reference result file
[graph_name].[algorithm].test       - GPU result file
[graph_name].[algorithm].timing     - reference time in msec
[graph_name].[algorithm].timing_gpu - GPU time in msec
[graph_name].[algorithm].pass       - exists if the regression test passed

The largest graph kron_g500-logn21 requires a card with 6GB of RAM to run, if you have
less, you will receive an out-of-memory error.  Cards with substantially less
memory may fail on some of the smaller graphs as well.

If you have reportlab installed, then running:

'python chartTest.py' will generate a simple set of bar graphs for displaying
the relative performance of the GPU GAS Engine vs PowerGraph.
