- MapGraph (0.3.2)

  This is a minor release. It replaces some code that was accidentally
  included in the MapGraph 0.3 distribution.

- MapGraph (0.3.1)

  This is a minor release. MPGraph is now called MapGraph.

- MapGraph (0.3)

  This release adds an alternative kernel strategy that provides better
  load balancing and a 5x - 10x increase in throughput for graph algorithms
  having multiple iterations with large frontiers.  This performance gain 
  can be easily observed with algorithms such as CC and PR.

- MapGraph (0.2) 
  
  This release replaces the initial thrust-based implementation
  entirely. The new implementation uses and extends the dynamic
  granularity techniques from Duane Merrill's b40c graph processing
  library and delivers a 10x performance improvement on BFS and SSSP.
  This release also includes a new API for high performance graph
  algorithms.  Bundled algorithms include BFS, SSSP, CC, PR.  Support
  for OpenMP, Intel Thread Building Blocks, and Intel Xeon Phi has
  been dropped in this release to focus on high performance algorithms
  on the GPU.

- Initial release (0.1) 30/07/2013.

  The initial release in coordination with the DARPA XDATA
  program. This release supports CUDA, OPEN MP, MIC, and TBB.  The
  list of implemented algorithms includes Breadth First Search (BFS),
  Connected Components (CC), PageRank (PR), Single Source Shortest
  Path (SSSP), and Betweenness Centrality (BC). For BC, the algorithm
  supports both exact and approximate BC.  Approximate BC is based on
  sampling. These algorithms have been implemented against the
  powergraph Gather Apply Scatter (GAS) API.  Performance has not been
  optimized in this release.
